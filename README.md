Note: The free app service plan on Azure has a limitation.
If the app is left idle for a very long time in hours, not only does it get idled out but the app as well as it's persistent storage is removed from memory.
To solve this problem, it is better to use an azure basic b1 service plan which is free for the first 30 days. There, just change the settings to Always on to prevent idling.
